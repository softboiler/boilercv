  abstract = {The motion of a vapor bubble in subcooled boiling was studied experimentally using slightly subcooled water, ethanol, and carbon-tetrachloride under the atmospheric pressure. The degree of subcooling ranged usually from about 2{$^\circ$}C to 50{$^\circ$}C, and in a few extreme cases it was extended to below 1{$^\circ$}C. The experimental data for the collapse stage were found to be well correlated by the equations which were derived by assuming a laminar heat trasfrer between the spherical bubble and the surrounding liquid with uniform subcoolings.}

  abstract = {The mechanics of vapor bubble collapse under spherically symmetrical conditions is examined to ascertain the relative importance of the effects of liquid inertia and heat transfer on the collapse rate. A dimensionless parameter, Beff, is identified to characterize the mode of collapse. Discriminating values of this parameter are suggested for the simple case where the collapse is initiated by a step change in pressure or temperature. For heat transfer controlled collapse, a model is also proposed to account for the influence of a permanent gas present in the bubble. Experimental results for bubbles with initial radii ranging from 0.3 cm to 0.9 cm collapsing in water and ethyl alcohol at atmospheric pressure levels and under free fall conditions are presented. The pressure difference ranges from 12 cm Hg to 63 cm Hg and the corresponding degrees of subcooling are 5 deg C to 45 deg C. Data are also given for water vapor bubbles containing significant amounts of nitrogen, helium, and xenon. When compared with theory, reasonable agreements are obtained. For slowly collapsing bubbles, the significance of small translational velocities is brought to attention. Photographic evidences are also given for bubble instability under suitable conditions.},

The present study also indicates that the nanoparticle deposition results in transient characteristics in the nucleate boiling heat transfer. Finally, this study investigates possible causes responsible for the deposition of nanoparticle on the heater surface. Experimental evidence shows that microlayer evaporation, during nanofluid boiling, is responsible for the nanoparticle coating formed on the heater surfaces. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Condensation of vapor bubbles in a subcooled liquid is known to influence heat transfer and pressure oscillation in subcooled boiling and direct contact condensation. This study reviews the published literature concerning interfacial heat transfer and bubble dynamics in the process of bubble condensation. The correlations for bubble condensation are analyzed and evaluated with a database covering a wide range of Reynolds, Jacob, and Prandtl numbers. Then, the investigations addressing bubble dynamics are reviewed, which focus on the bubble condensation patterns, motion, collapse, and the pressure oscillations induced by bubble condensation, as well as the effect of noncondensable gas and field. Despite the extensive experiments of bubble condensation available in the literature, it is shown that there is still a shortage of investigation focused on the variation of thermal boundary layer and turbulence formed near the bubble at the micro-scale, which could help to develop the prediction method of bubble condensation in the future. The transportation of noncondensable gas inside the mixture bubble and effect of capillary waves formed on the bubble surface on the actual vapor-liquid contact area and thermal boundary are also suggested to be further investigated to gain the thorough understanding of the bubble condensation process.},

  abstract = {The condensation of steam bubbles injected into a large diameter vertical pipe (100 mm) with flowing low-subcooled water at low pressure conditions (similar to 1.1-1.5 bar) was experimentally investigated. The analysis of the experimental investigations will contribute to a better understanding of bubble condensation at low pressures, which is of interest to the safety analysis of nuclear power plants, and any industrial activity in which bubble condensation is of importance. The test section is a transparent 1 m long plastic pipe surrounded by a 18 x 18 cm rectangular ``aquarium'' filled with water for refraction correction. High-speed camera (HSC) recording was used to gather data about condensing bubbles including: bubble diameter, shape and rising velocity. The isolation of the steam condensation from evaporation in these experiments enabled us to concentrate on the condensation process alone with well-defined flow conditions. Steam was injected via three different injection nozzles directly near the center of the test section. The present experiments were carried out at three different steam superficial velocities, water superficial velocities and water temperatures for each injection nozzle. Raw images were recorded at 1500 frame/s and 0.32 mm/pixel spatial resolution for a total time of 2 s in each measurement. The raw images were processed by self-developed programs in order to identify and track the condensing bubbles after detachment, and to measure their diameter, velocity, position, and aspect ratio. The measurements made possible the calculation of both the bubble Reynolds number and the Nusselt number and, thus, a Nu-Re correlation was developed. The measurements extend the already available database for the validation of interfacial heat and mass transfer correlations. These are used for instance in CFD simulations where steam bubble condensation plays an important role. The analysis of the results presented shows also new and interesting observations for large bubbles with high Reynolds number such as: large deformation, deviation from spherical form, rough and vibrating bubble surfaces, and enhanced heat transfer coefficient. The experiments show a large effect of bubble surface structure, bubble rising velocity, and initial injection velocity upon the condensation rate. Based on the analysis of the results, a new correlation of the Nusselt condensation number has been proposed for the investigated range of bubble diameter and Reynolds number. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {For predicting the void fraction distribution in subcooled flow boiling, it is necessary to measure the interfacial heat transfer coefficient-which determines the amount of condensation rate of vapor bubble-with high accuracy. In this study, the relationship among the bubble number distributions, void fraction, bubble collapse rate and phase change rate was clarified through measurement of the average interfacial heat transfer coefficient using image analysis under the condition of forced convectional subcooled flow boiling. The bubble number distributions were measured by translating bubble images observed by a high-speed camera. The bubble collapse rates were obtained by the process of bubble number. The obtained bubble collapse rates were possible to predict the decrease rate of the void fraction in low subcooling condition with high accuracy. The average heat transfer coefficient was shown to depend on the interfacial area concentration, via calculation of the average interfacial heat transfer using the obtained bubble number distribution. The developed experimental correlation of the interfacial heat transfer with the interfacial area concentration was compared with the measured value, and the interfacial heat transfer using the developed correlation equation corresponded to the measured one. A comparison with previous correlation equations for interfacial heat transfer coefficients and consideration of the bubble number distribution confirmed the applicability of the experimental correlation of the interfacial heat transfer coefficient to a boiling channel.},

  abstract = {An experimental investigation of the dynamics of, and the heat transfer to, the vapor bubbles condensing in a miscible or an immiscible liquid is presented in this paper. Unpublished experiments of Freon-113, pentane and hexane bubbles condensing in water and Freon-113 bubbles condensing in subcooled Freon-113 are analyzed and compared to previously published experiments of pentane/water, isopentane/water and pentane/glycerol systems. The experimental results of both the mechanical and thermal behaviors are compared to existing models. Throughout the comparison, we examine the effect of the shape and rigidity of condensing bubbles as well as the effects of the contaminants and noncondensibles on the velocity of, and the heat transfer to, the bubbles. Empirical correlations for the drag coefficient and the Nusselt number for a wide range of experimental parameters are developed. These correlations are simple to use (especially in contrast to existing complicated models requiring numerical solutions) and agree well with the experimental results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Hydrophone records give the frequency, pressure amplitude, and decay characteristics of the sound produced by a single bubble. The measured frequency agreed with the natural oscillation frequency of the bubble (the Minnaert frequency); the pressure amplitude gives the amplitude of oscillation of the bubble wall; the decay time broadly agrees with the value expected for radiative acoustic damping and thermal damping. The underwater sounds produced by natural brooks were recorded and found predominantly to consist of a succession of Minnaert-like oscillations, thereby allowing the bubble-size distributions to be obtained from the sound spectra.},

  abstract = {Subcooled boiling has been subject of extensive research studies in the literature. So far, the approach of studying the phenomena of subcooled boiling has rather been an integral method by measuring the heat transport from the wall to the liquid and by following the growth and collapse of the bubbles. However, little is known about the heat transport at the phase interface between the surface of the bubbles and the subcooled liquid. Experimental attempts to study the transport phenomena around the bubble surface quantitatively have been performed by using the holographic interferometry, an optical method, which works in an inertialess and non-invasive way. The conventional holographic interferometry has somewhat been modified by applying the finite fringe method. With this technique interesting insights could be gained and precise quantitative data could be evaluated.},

  abstract = {Investigation was carried out concerning the effects of ultrasonic field on the condensation and collapse of vapor bubbles in a quiescent subcooled pool. Experimental results showed that the vapor bubbles were split gradually at liquid subcooling of 15-30 K, while were collapsed into many tiny bubbles when subcooling was higher than 40 K. Once the ultrasonic vibration was applied, capillary waves would arise on the bubble surface, and the threshold of liquid subcooling for collapsing the bubble was diminished to 20-26 K. Further, the presence of capillary wave increased the contacting area of the bubble with the cold bulk, and disturbs the thermal boundary layer in the vicinity of the vapor-liquid interface, resulting in the enhancement of condensation process. Therefore, the inertial shock of liquid on the vapor bubble was much stronger than that without ultrasonic vibration at the same liquid subcooling. This would also accelerate the instability of the bubble surface in turn. Based on the experimental data at liquid subcooling of 15-60 K, empirical correlations were given to predict the condensation heat transfer of vapor bubbles with and without ultrasonic, with deviations within +/- 30\%.

  abstract = {In order to develop a mechanistic model for the subcooled flow boiling process, the key issues which must be addressed are wall heat flux partitioning and interfacial (condensation) heat transfer. The sink term in the two-fluid models for void fraction prediction is provided by the condensation rate at the vapor-liquid interface. Low pressure subcooled flow boiling experiments, using water, were performed using a vertical flat plate heater to investigate the bubble collapse process. A high-speed CCD camera was used to record the bubble collapse in the bulk subcooled liquid. Based on the analyses of these digitized images, bubble collapse rates and the associated heat transfer rate were determined. The experimental data were in turn used to correlate the bubble collapse rate and the interfacial heat transfer rate. These correlations are functions of bubble Reynolds number, liquid Prandtl number, Jacob number. and Fourier number. The correlations account for both the effect of forced convection heat transfer and thickening of the thermal boundary layer as the vapor bubble condenses which in turn makes the condensation heat transfer time dependent. Comparison of the measured experimental data with those predicted from the correlations show that predictions are well within 25\% of the experimentally measured values. These correlations have also been compared with those available in the literature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Using holographic interferometry and high-speed cinematography the heat transfer at the phase interface of vapor bubbles condensing in a subcooled liquid of the same substance was measured with ethanol, propanol, refrigerant R113 and water. To evaluate the axisymmetric temperature field around the bubble from the interference fringe field, the Abel integral method is not sufficient. A correction procedure considering the light deflection caused by the local temperature gradient has been developed and applied to calculate the heat transfer coefficient. The measurements were performed in the range 2 {$<$} Pr {$<$} 15 and I {$<$} Ja {$<$} 120. Measured data could be well-correlated as functions of the Prandtl and Reynolds numbers for the heat transfer coefficient and as functions of the Reynolds, Prandtl and Jacob numbers for the bubble collapse time.}

  abstract = {The interfacial heat transfer coefficient is an important parameter for the analysis of multi-phase flow. In subcooled boiling flow, bubbles condense through the interface of phases and the interfacial heat transfer determines the condensation rate which affects the two-phase parameters such as void fraction and local liquid temperature. Thus, the present experiments are conducted to correlate the interfacial heat transfer coefficient at low pressure in the subcooled boiling flow. The local liquid temperature is measured by microthermocouple and the bubble condensation rate is estimated by orthogonal, two-image processing. The condensate Nusselt number, which is a function of bubble Reynolds number, local liquid Prandtl number, and local Jacob number, is obtained from the experimental results. The bubble history is derived from the newly proposed correlation and the condensate Nusselt number is compared with the previous models.}

  abstract = {In two-fluid modeling, accurate prediction of the interfacial transport of mass, momentum, and energy is required. Experiments were carried out to obtain a data base for the development of interfacial transport models, or correlations, for subcooled water--steam bubbly flow in vertical conduits. The experimental data of interest included the interfacial area concentration, interfacial condensation heat transfer, and bubble relative velocity. In the present investigation, bubble condensation in subcooled water--steam flow in a vertical annulus at low flow rate and low pressure is investigated experimentally. A high-speed video system (up to 1000 frame/s) was used to visualize two orthogonal views of the flow simultaneously. A digital image processing technique was used to track and measure the velocity and size of the collapsing bubbles. The axial void fraction distribution was also measured by a single beam gamma densitometer. The results were compared with existing correlations and a new correlation for bubble condensation Nusselt number was obtained based on the present data. In the proposed correlation, the bubble condensation Nusselt number is expressed in terms of the bubble Reynolds number, Jakob number, and void fraction. The latter term accounts for the multi-bubble effect. This correlation can predict the present data within {\textpm}20 percent with a correlation coefficient of 96 percent.}
